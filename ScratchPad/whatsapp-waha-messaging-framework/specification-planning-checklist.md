# WhatsApp WAHA Messaging Framework - Specification Planning Checklist

## Project Overview
AI-powered medical assistant chatbot framework working through WhatsApp using WAHA and ntfy.

## Specification Writing Checklist

### [✓] Getting started
- [✓] Create a checklist in ScratchPad to track progress of the specification writing
- [✓] Set up directory structure for research and documentation

### [✓] Collect high-level requirements
- [✓] Ask user about the high-level requirements of the feature or system
- [✓] Understand the purpose of the feature or system
- [✓] Document immediate goals (hello world sender, echo responder)
- [✓] Document long-term vision (AI medical assistant)

### [✓] Research for existing solutions / technologies / documentation
- [✓] Research WAHA (WhatsApp HTTP API) capabilities and documentation
- [✓] Research ntfy for webhook handling
- [✓] Look for existing .NET WhatsApp integration libraries
- [✓] Research .NET Core 9.0 console service patterns

### [✓] Understand current implementation
- [✓] Check current codebase structure
- [✓] Identify existing components or starting point
- [✓] Understand current project setup

### [✓] Search online for relevant technologies and documentation
- [✓] Research WAHA API documentation and examples
- [✓] Research ntfy webhook setup and integration
- [✓] Look for .NET Core 9.0 best practices for console services
- [✓] Research design patterns for messaging frameworks

### [✓] Gather user expectations
- [✓] Ask user about their expectations from the feature or system
- [✓] Understand the user experience they are looking for
- [✓] Refine the requirements based on user feedback

### [✓] Decide if need to loop again
- [✓] Check if the specification is complete
- [✓] Requirements are clear and complete

### [✓] Write the specification document
- [✓] Create appropriate directory in docs/features folder
- [✓] Organize specification document with clear structure
- [✓] Include detailed requirements with acceptance criteria

## Current Status
✅ **Architecture Revision Complete** - Updated all documentation to reflect ntfy polling approach instead of direct webhooks.

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Architecture**: .NET Core 9.0 console application with WAHA integration
2. **Phase 1**: One-time command execution for "hello world" sending
3. **Phase 2**: ntfy polling service for echo responses (REVISED)
4. **Integration Pattern**: WAHA → ntfy (webhook) → .NET App (polling) + .NET App → ntfy (monitoring)
5. **Technology Stack**: .NET Core 9.0, Docker (WAHA), HTTP APIs, ntfy polling
6. **Project Structure**: Multi-project solution with Core, HelloWorld, and MessageReceiver projects (REVISED)
7. **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and performance testing with >80% coverage
8. **Extensibility**: Interface-based design ready for AI medical assistant features

## Deliverables Created
- ✅ **Requirements Document**: `docs/features/whatsapp-waha-messaging-framework/requirements.md`
- ✅ **Design Document**: `docs/features/whatsapp-waha-messaging-framework/design.md` (REVISED)
- ✅ **Task Planner**: `docs/features/whatsapp-waha-messaging-framework/tasks.md` (REVISED)
- ✅ **Architecture Revision**: `docs/features/whatsapp-waha-messaging-framework/architecture-revision.md` (NEW)
- ✅ **Research Documentation**: Complete ScratchPad with user feedback and technical research

## Major Architecture Changes Applied
- **WebhookReceiver** → **MessageReceiver** (project renamed)
- **ASP.NET Core webhook endpoints** → **Background polling service**
- **Direct webhook handling** → **ntfy message relay with polling**
- **Immediate HTTP responses** → **Polling loop with configurable intervals**
- **Public endpoint requirements** → **No infrastructure requirements**

## Task Planner Updates
- **Task 3**: Enhanced ntfy service with both polling and notification capabilities
- **Task 5**: Complete revision from webhook infrastructure to polling infrastructure  
- **Task 7**: Added WAHA webhook configuration for ntfy targets
- **Task 8**: Updated testing approach for polling scenarios
- **Success Criteria**: Revised to reflect ntfy polling workflow

## Ready for Implementation
All documentation now reflects the pragmatic ntfy polling approach that eliminates deployment barriers while maintaining full functionality.
