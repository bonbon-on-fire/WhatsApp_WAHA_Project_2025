# ntfy Webhook Research Report

## Key Findings About ntfy

### What ntfy IS
- **Primary Purpose**: HTTP-based pub-sub notification service ([ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh/))
- **Core Functionality**: Send notifications TO devices/clients, not receive FROM external services
- **API Pattern**: Simple HTTP POST to publish messages to topics

### Publishing to ntfy (What it DOES support)
```bash
# Basic message publishing
curl -d "Hello World" ntfy.sh/mytopic

# HTTP POST with JSON
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"topic":"mytopic","message":"Hello World"}' \
  ntfy.sh/
```

### What ntfy DOES NOT Support Natively
- **Webhook Receiver**: ntfy is NOT designed to act as a webhook endpoint
- **Message Processing**: ntfy doesn't process incoming webhook data
- **Two-way Communication**: ntfy is publish-only, not bidirectional

## Integration Patterns Found

### Pattern 1: Webhook-to-ntfy Bridge
- **Project**: [webhook-to-ntfy](https://github.com/martabal/webhook-to-ntfy)
- **Purpose**: Acts as intermediary to receive webhooks and forward to ntfy
- **Use Case**: External services → webhook-to-ntfy → ntfy topic

### Pattern 2: Custom Integration (Recommended for our use case)
- **Flow**: WAHA → Our .NET App (webhook receiver) → ntfy (notifications)
- **Benefit**: Full control over message processing and response logic
- **Implementation**: Our app acts as webhook endpoint and uses ntfy for notifications

### Pattern 3: Third-party Integration Platforms
- **Example**: [Pipedream WhatsApp + ntfy integration](https://pipedream.com/apps/ntfy/integrations/whatsapp-business)
- **Purpose**: No-code workflow between WhatsApp Business API and ntfy
- **Limitation**: Doesn't work with WAHA specifically

## Recommended Architecture for Our Project

Based on research findings, the optimal flow should be:

```
WhatsApp Message → WAHA → Our .NET App (Webhook Endpoint) → Process Message → Send Echo via WAHA
                                   ↓
                            ntfy (Optional Notifications)
```

### Why This Architecture?
1. **ntfy Limitation**: ntfy cannot directly receive and process WAHA webhooks
2. **Control**: Our .NET app needs to process messages and send echo responses
3. **Flexibility**: We can use ntfy for logging/monitoring notifications if desired

## Implementation Implications

### Phase 1: Hello World Sender
- **Direct WAHA Integration**: .NET app → WAHA API
- **No webhook needed**: Simple HTTP POST to WAHA's `/api/sendText` endpoint

### Phase 2: Echo Responder
- **Webhook Receiver**: .NET app must provide HTTP endpoint for WAHA webhooks
- **Message Processing**: Parse webhook, extract message, format echo response
- **Response Sending**: HTTP POST back to WAHA to send echo
- **Optional ntfy**: Send notifications about processed messages

## Next Steps
1. Clarify with user if they want ntfy for notifications/logging
2. Design .NET app as primary webhook receiver
3. Use WAHA's webhook configuration to point to our .NET app
4. Optionally integrate ntfy for monitoring/notifications
