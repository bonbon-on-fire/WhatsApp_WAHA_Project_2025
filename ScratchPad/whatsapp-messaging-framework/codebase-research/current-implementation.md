# Current Implementation Analysis
## Workspace Status
- Empty workspace (only .git and ScratchPad directories)
- No existing package.json or Node.js project structure
- No existing WPPConnect implementation
- Git history shows deleted files: design.md, requirements.md, tasks.md
## Previous Work
Based on git status, there may have been previous documentation or planning files that were removed:
- design.md (deleted)
- requirements.md (deleted) 
- tasks.md (deleted)
## Current State
- **Implementation Status**: Starting from scratch
- **Technology Stack**: Not yet defined
- **Dependencies**: None currently installed
- **Project Structure**: Needs to be created
## Next Steps for Implementation
1. Initialize Node.js project with package.json
2. Install WPPConnect and related dependencies
3. Set up basic project structure
4. Implement core messaging functionality
5. Add logging and message storage capabilities
